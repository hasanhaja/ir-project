# Image Segmentation Metrics

- mIoU
- mAcc
- aAcc

## IoU

What is it?

Pros and cons of this metric? What does it tell? What does it not tell? (speed probably)

# NN metrics

- F1 score

# SemSeg metrics

- Pixel accuracy or Global pixel-wise accuracy
- IoU
- F1 score

# Questions

- What metrics do you need to quantify the quality of a semantic segmentation model? Are image segmentation metrics sufficient?
