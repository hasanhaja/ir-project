# Planned Reading List

The flow of the lists is as follows:

1. Collect potentially relevant and interesting papers to [Heap](#Heap).
2. Sort them into either [Planned](#Planned) or [Dismissed](#Dismissed)
3. Comment on the papers that were dismissed with a reason why. For eg. "outdated research", "superceded by _this_ paper".
