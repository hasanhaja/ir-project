# Selection criteria

This is based on prior reading and looking at the [PASCAL VOC leaderboards](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/leaderboard/main_bootstrap.php). The particular leaderboard of interest is object segmentation on VOC2012 data (PASCAL and additional).

# Trained on PASCAL VOC 2012

You can select based on classes

- XC-FLATTENT (12 Jan 2020) [Highest mean]
  - No pytorch implementation
- FDNet_16s (22 Mar 2020) [2nd]
  - No pytorch implementation
- DeepLabv3_plus_reproduction (11 May 2019) [12th]
  - Reproduction of deeplabv3+ with tensorflow
  - No code
- Waterfall Atrous Spatial Pooling Arch for Sem Seg (19 Nov 2019)

I'm not entirely happy with these because the classes don't match, and that already means I have to retrain things.

# Trained on addtional data

- EfficientNet-L2 + NAS-FPN + Noisy Student (15 Jun 2020) [highest mean]
- RecoNet152_coco (15 Jun 2020) [2nd highest mean]
  - Tencent
- DeepLabv3+ (09 Feb 2018) [12th highest mean]
  - Proposed model available as tensorflow option
- DeepLabv3+\_JFT (09 Feb 2018) [3rd highest mean]

  - Finetuning a model pretrained by JFT-300M dataset.

- Auto-DeepLab-L (11 Jan 2019) [trained without any pretraining from imagenet]
- Deep Layer Cascade (LC) (06 Apr 2017) []
- ESPNetv2 (23 Mar 2019) [light-weight and power efficient]
  - Source code available
  - Pytorch
  - Could be reference material on [evaluation code and performance calculation code](https://github.com/sacmehta/ESPNetv2/tree/master/segmentation)
  - Cannot find pretrained models
- PSPNet (06 Dec 2016) [Good cityscape benchmark]
- Tree-structured Kronecker Convolution Networks (20 Apr 2018) [Tackling an issue with atrous convolution]
- Res2Net (22 Feb 2020) [one below PSPNet on the leaderboard]
  - [Source available](https://github.com/Res2Net/Res2Net-PretrainedModels)
  - Pytorch
  - Pretrained available
  - Might need to retrain fully connected layer
- Feature_Pyramid
  - [Source available](https://github.com/wanggrun/Learning-Feature-Pyramids)
  - Trained on ImageNet and/or VOC
  - Trained models available (resnet50 and 101 based)
  - Tensorflow based
  - Might need to retrain fully connected layer
- RefineNet
    - [Matlab based](https://github.com/guosheng/refinenet) but [pytorch version](https://github.com/DrSleep/refinenet-pytorch) also exists
    - [Pretrained model is available](https://github.com/guosheng/refinenet)
    - Can the pretrained model (generated by matlab) by imported by the pytorch implementation?


# Shortlisted

- DeepLabv3_Resnet101_voc
- PSPNet
- Res2Net
- Another DeepLabv3 implementation? Like [Deeplab_Xception](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception),
