# State of the Art

## Datasets

The datasets being considered are considered for their use in semantic segmentation for the purpose of transport applications (i.e. autonomous vehicle scene understanding).

Most popular datasets for semantic segmentation are:

* Cityscapes 
* PASCAL VOC
* Microsoft COCO

Datasets specifically for autonomous driving scenarios:

* Mapillary
* Apolloscape
* Berkeley DeepDrive

### What is the difference between Cityscapes and Mapillary and Apolloscape?


### Cityscapes

* What are the classes that are labelled?

### PASCAL VOC & Microsoft COCO

These are general semantic segmentation 

* What are the classes that are labelled?


### Similarities between the datasets

## Methods

* Cityscapes pixel level semantic labelling. All methods are trained on the finely labelled dataset, but some are further trained on the coarse dataset.

# Questions

* What the hell is Panoptic segmentation?
