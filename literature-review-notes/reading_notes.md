# Computer Vision for Autonomous Vehicles: Problems, Datasets and State of the Art <a name="state-of-the-art"></a>

## Topics covered

- Semantic Segmentation
- Semantic Instance Segmentation

## Key points

- ResNet behave as linear ensemble of shallow networks
- In video applications, temporal frames correlation can be exploited for better image segmentation accuracy, efficiency and robustness.
- "3D reconstruction works relatively well for static scenes but is still an open problem in dynamic scenes."

## Areas introduced here to explore further

- What are feature maps?
- Optical flow
  - Isn't this only useful in scenes in motion for reconstructive the environment?
